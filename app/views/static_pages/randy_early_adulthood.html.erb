        <span id="textspang">Working for Early Bird<br /></span><span id="textspang1"><br />I worked for my brothers after high school doing <a id="underline" href="http://earlybirdlandscaping.com">sprinkling and landscaping</a>. They were doing well with their business, but when the <a id="underline" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEdM6Ys6spA">Teton Dam broke in 1976</a>, it really took off as people started repairing all the damage that had been done. The flood wiped out Rexburg, or most of it -- people’s entire homes were uprooted and floating downstream -- so everyone was getting reimbursed for all of their losses. The flood actually came up to the backyard of our house on Reid Street, so we put out mattresses to block the doors. The Arctic Circle that belonged to my parents was heavily flooded, along with their apartments and other rentals as well. <br /><br />I worked for my brothers, who were all partners in the business. Mike and Marlon started it and Robert came home from his mission and bought into it. My dad helped them get started. He was like a salesman for them. I was the gopher, digging ditches and going for this and going for that. They all worked well together and made a lot of money. They all built homes down there in the Rigby valley, discovered the area and developed it. The golf course was there at that time too, but they’ve enlarged it since then. Grandpa owned a lot of land in that area as well. </span>

        <span id="textspang2">College<br /><br /></span><span id="textspang3">After graduating high school, I enrolled in Ricks College and went two semesters while working for my brothers in the off time. I took regular general classes. I wasn’t really into my studies. I was about a B student. I did well, but I wasn’t motivated to do extremely well because I was going to be working more as a laborer than as a professional accountant or engineer or something like that. I just didn’t have those desires or drive to do those things. I knew I was going to run my own business one day, so school didn’t seem that important at the time. Most of my classes were centered around business and basic math, statistics, those sorts of courses that would help me to own and operate a business eventually.</span>

I never had any questions in my mind about that. I always knew I would and it was just part of the plan that I had made for myself. It was part of the family tradition as well. All my brothers and sisters had gone on missions and so I felt I should go and never questioned it. </span><br />

        <p id="I_was_called_to_the_Oakland_California_Spanish-speaking_Missio">
        I was called to the California Oakland Mission, speaking Spanish. After a year of college, I started my mission on September 16, 1976.  I served two years in the Bay Area. It was very good for me to get out of Idaho and to see a different part of the country. I had rarely left Idaho since we didn’t travel that much back in those days. We’d go to Salt Lake or Boise or go on vacation, but other than that we just didn’t have the interaction and knowledge of the rest of the world like people would have now. It was quite an experience for me to leave and go to San Francisco. That’s where I served in my first area - the Mission District, which was a pretty rough area, maybe the roughest area in the mission. My first companion Elder Walker and I were both fairly new missionaries. He knew Spanish and I was training with him. Spanish came slowly to me, not real fast, but steady and consist. I enjoyed it and I enjoyed studying and getting closer to the Lord in my missionary experience. We had several baptisms in San Francisco in those first few months. <br /><br />Later I moved out closer to Sacramento, the Antioch area, which was a pretty barren area. We didn’t have any baptisms there for the six months that I was there. It was pretty difficult. I had some strenuous situations with my companion as well. But it was all for my good. It taught me that I needed to stretch myself. I needed to study hard and work. I knew how to work, but I didn’t know how to apply knowledge to the efforts I was making in missionary work. <br /><br />After being in the Antioch area, I came back to the Bay Area to San Bruno and spent the next eight months there. It was my favorite area. I was with Elder Robinson for five of those eight months and we had a lot of success. We baptized lots of people and it was probably the most enjoyable part of my time in the mission. We had a great ward organization and a good mission leader, which I think really contributed to our success there.<br />

        <p id="_I_finished_off_my_mission_right_after_the_mission_split_into_t">
        I finished off my mission right after the mission split into the California San Jose mission and spent the last six months down in the southern San Jose area. The highlight of that was baptizing the Condors Family with their six children. They were a really good family, but they were struggling. We tracked into them and the mother Pam let us in the door. She had heard that the Osmonds were Mormon and they were on TV all the time, so she wanted to learn more about their religion. We ended up baptizing Pam and her husband Art and five of their six children. It was quite a change in their lifestyle as he was a truck driver. Kind of a smoker and drinker type. He struggled in the gospel, but they had these six kids that were from 7-14 years of age. Pam was worried about them and wanted them to have some religion. They all got involved in the church to some degree or another. I was there for another couple months before my mission ended and I know they were in and out of activity for years. <br /><br />They eventually ended up moving to Utah to try and find a better place to raise their kids and strengthen their family. It was just a wonderful testimony-building experience to see the gospel come into people’s lives and change them for the better. In this case, Art, who was probably looked at through his kids’ eyes as a good father, but not as a righteous man. The gospel gave him the opportunity to preside in his family, receive the Priesthood and work on becoming a righteous man, a provider and a protector of his family. That theme just ran throughout the gospel wherever I went. Those are the things that fathers needs to do and if they take on those responsibilities, they’ll be respected and successful. They’ll progress and feel a satisfaction of having the Priesthood to bless their families and others. They can become a leader among their children and among their fellow men, all to the good of their lives.

        <p id="Surprise_Homecoming_I_came_home_from_my_mission_just_in_time_t">
        <span id="textspang6">Surprise Homecoming<br /></span><span id="textspang7"><br />I came home from my mission just in time to enroll in Ricks College for the fall semester. I was actually a couple weeks late, because it was into September and Ricks College started in August. I can remember my brother Robert pulling all the cards for me to get my classes. Back then the computer information was put on cards with punch holes - very old-fashioned. But all the colleges were trying to install computers to help speed up the bookwork they were involved in. He pulled all the cards for the classes I needed even though I wasn’t there. Since the new San Jose mission was just created, there was a brand new Mission President and office staff and everything was just getting started in July. I ended up coming home just the beginning of September and things were pretty chaotic because of the creation of the new mission. <br /><br />I can remember that I didn’t get any information on when I was supposed to go home. I called in and they said they were working on it but hadn’t done it yet. In fact, they said if I could make the arrangements that would be best. I secured my own flight and the date for returning home. Because it was a new mission, they were a little out of sorts. I decided it would be fun to play a little trick on my family. As one of dozens of missionaries in the large Bird family, there were homecomings every 4-5 months. It was pretty common to have missionaries going out and missionaries coming home. So the mischievous side of me decided to not let my family know the exact date of when I was coming home. My release date was in the middle of September, but I had permission to get home earlier so I could get into college. <br /><br />I don’t recall the date, but I contacted Todd (who had served his mission in Canada and had already been home for three weeks) and I arranged with him to pick me up at the airport. No one knew; they thought it was a week or two away. So there I was flying home from my mission, landing in Idaho Falls airport and instead of having dozens of people there to greet me, there was no one there except Todd. He picked me up and we thought we were pretty cool and mischievous. So he drove me into Rexburg and my goal was to surprise all the members in my family, starting with my mother. <br /><br />She worked at the public health department as a district nurse and she was right there next to the Arctic Circle. I gave my camera to Todd and he walked in through the back door of my mother’s office and I was just down the stairs listening. He walked in and she said, “Oh Todd, good to see you. What are you up to?” They were just chit chatting and he had my camera and my mother recognized it. She said, “Is that your camera?” And he said, “No, it’s Randy’s!” She had this puzzled look on her face and this was kind of my cue, so I walked up the stairs and opened up the door and stood there in front of her and her mouth literally dropped to the ground. She was quite shocked to see me. </span><br />

        <p id="_Of_course_the_first_thing_she_said_was_“What_are_you_doing_">
        Of course, the first thing she said was, “What are you doing here? You’re supposed to still be on your mission. Were you honorably released?” I assured her I was and that the San Jose Mission had allowed me to come home a few weeks earlier. So she forgave me, I think. She literally had a heart attack at that moment. From that point on we went around and found my dad up at the apartments and surprised him. We visited each of my brothers who were out on some jobs working, putting in sprinkling and landscaping. I put on my white overalls, which is what we worked in, and just showed up on the job and had a good time. Todd and I spent the afternoon doing this and it was a very fun time. It was the perfect way to come home after being gone for two years.<br />
