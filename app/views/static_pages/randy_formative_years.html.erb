        <p id="Middle_and_High_School_My_junior_high_school_campus_was_locate">
        <span id="textspanf">Middle and High School<br /></span><span id="textspanf1"><br />My junior high school campus was located downtown near the Arctic Circle. During that time, I worked ever so often during school lunch. My older brothers worked there plenty, and the responsibility trickled down as my brothers left home. My sisters, I believe, did not have the same responsibility. There was always a frenzy for lunch, a huge group of people would come by, including friends. For 75 cents, you could get a medium-size hamburger, drink, and fries. I would come in through the back door of the Arctic Circle, and for 20 minutes we'd have this packed store, full of a hundred high school and jr. high kids ordering food. Fries and hamburgers were everywhere, drinks served by the dozens, just a complete mad house for 20 minutes. I'd go into the back room and eat my lunch. It was convenient because being next door to campus, I could always hear the bell ring.<br /><br />Most students wanted a 25 cent burger, 25 cent fries and a 25 cent drink. They’d hand you a buck and you’d hand them back a quarter. Some would get a 15 cent cherry pie turnover. When I got done with that, we’d play basketball behind the restaurant. My father made great on any situation, and so he installed a basketball hoop on the back of the building. I always worked for a few minutes, ate lunch, and then played basketball with friends. I never played on a team in high school because I was late sprouting, but I could shoot. I would win intramural tournaments shooting free throws. My favorite activities during those years was playing basketball and snowmobiling.<br /></span>

        <p id="_I_worked_at_the_Arctic_Circle_off_and_on_for_years_Wages_wer">
        I worked at the Arctic Circle off and on for years. Wages were $1.35 or so per hour. Arctic Circle was a drive-in as well, so people could drive up to a window stall and a waitress would come out and take the order. Carhops would come out and deliver the food. Occasionally, money would blow off the trays, not to be recovered. There were so many windy days in Rexburg. Every couple of weeks, I would mow the grass down, and pick up mountains of debris and trash that built up from the drive in area. It was bordered on the west by Mrs. Lutz’s home, which was about 150 years old. Dad always wanted to buy her place, so I would clean her yard and mow her lawn so Dad could get on her good side and buy her property. Sometimes there would be money among the weeds -- one or two dollars -- and we would get to keep the money that we found, which was always a plus. I liked working for my dad. I remember working for someone else my junior year of high school moving pipe for a few weeks. It was not a good lifestyle and I had to be around some pretty rough characters. I didn’t like it all. The other workers would call you names if you didn’t drink their beer or fit into their group. Working for my dad was always more enjoyable. <br /><br />Dad was always a good motivator, and had a pleasant smile. He could mix well with anyone, and was quite social. He was not a typical introverted farmer. Every family has a social parent, who becomes more social than the other. In my family, it was my dad. When we'd get done with church, all of us would be out by the car waiting for my dad, who was always caught up talking to people, arranging this or that. This, I believe, was why he was successful at his restaurant. <br /><br />There was a new high school built in 1972. I graduated in 1975, and experienced most of high school in a brand new building! It was conveniently a half block from my home, quite different from the downtown junior high campus. Most of the time I would just come home for lunch and make food. Friends often came with me because we all lived so close. I felt privileged to be able to pop home anytime I chose. It was more like college because you signed up for classes and it was an open campus. The majority of schools back then, I believe, were closed campuses. The schedule was built with few windows, a modular system customizable by the students, which we all really liked.

        <span id="textspanf2">Best Friends<br /></span><span id="textspanf3"><br />Our home on Reid street was only 1/2 a block from the high school. Most of the time I’d bring home my best friend Todd. We were very close. He lived about three blocks away from my house and his parents still live in the same spot to this day. We played basketball at Todd’s place a lot. That’s where I learned to dunk. We were always trying to dunk a basketball. I could dunk a volleyball, but I couldn’t dunk a basketball. Just didn’t have enough jumps yet. We played at his place and played a lot of basketball at our place on Reid street with Nerf balls. There was a hoop inside there, so we’d play for hours, pushing and shoving, almost like football basketball. It was winter most of the time in Rexburg, so that’s why we played indoors. <br /><br />My friend Todd and I were pretty much inseparable. I think we had several classes together. Most my classes were related to math and science. He later went on to become an engineer in geology. My senior year we had a lot of free time together and went off to do fun things. We were &nbsp;never wild, as that wasn’t in our nature, but we knew that our high school days were going to be ending soon. There have been a few years we haven’t kept in touch, but usually always on birthdays we’ve connected over the years. Todd calls me every year on my birthday. It’s been going on forever. Lately he’s called multiple times and sent lots of cards. He lives in Blackfoot now and has a nice home there.<br /><br />My last semester of high school was spent in the DECA program, which meant I got high school credit working for my brothers. I spent March, April and May working for my brothers and not going to high school at all and just working in the sprinkler and landscaping business. I very much enjoyed that. High school was good, but I wasn’t really into the high school scene too much. I rarely dated, as I was more afraid of girls than wanting to date them. The two or three dating experiences I had weren’t that great. I was just content to not be involved in that scene hardly at all. Mostly, I just stuck to playing baskeball.</span>

        <p id="Snowmobiling_My_father_had_a_number_of_side_businesses_He_ren">
        <span id="textspanf4">Snowmobiling<br /></span><span id="textspanf5"><br /></span><span id="textspanf6">My father had a number of side businesses. He rented snowmobiles (a new invention) for winter in Yellowstone, and he rented trailers for the summer that were about 12-15 feet long. I helped put them together mechanically. During the winter, which was 4-5 months of the year in Rexburg, we loved snowmobiling. I remember coming home and pretending to do my homework so I could go out and snowmobile. I was a solid B student. I never had academic pressure put on me to excel in school. I remember having a good work ethic, but not necessarily in my academics. My learning style is more kinesthetic, which had a lot to do with my family living on a farm. Even in junior high and high school, I worked hard taking care of a lot of the mechanical things at the restaurant. And later, I had snowmobiles to put together and trailers to rent out. I enjoyed working with my hands, as I still do now. <br /><br />My friend Todd had his parents buy him a snowmobile, so we could go snowmobiling together (often, there was only one left at home). There was usually 3-4 feet of snow and we’d learn to do crazy things and be independent. It was a very enjoyable, positive situation. Todd and I would drive snowmobiles right out of our driveway on Reid Street and go up Mill Hollow right up into the dry farms. We didn’t have to trailer anything. The snowmobiles were in the garage and the cars were kept outside. The garage was for the snowmobiles, which I guess shows where our family’s priorities were. <br /><br />One early spring day in my late teens, Todd and I went on a Saturday afternoon snowmobile trip up at Island Park. We loaded the snowmobiles up in the back of the pickup, loaded all of our gear and spent a day up there along the Big Springs highway. We had a blast on a bright sunny day just having a great time. The only thing we were worried about was running out of gas because we were just going everywhere. The snow was 6-7 ft deep and it was later in the spring, probably March or April. The snow was starting to get soft. You had to be careful around the Big Springs river because there were marshes that would start melting out from underneath the grass. So you could snowmobile on this nice beautiful snow and all of a sudden the bottom would fall out. Then you’d be in real trouble because your snow machine could literally sink into the water. So those are the things you’re concerned with along the river bank. <br /><br />This one particular time as we were going in and out of the trees along the river, I was going pretty fast and came upon this melted out spot that was more like a small ravine. Instead of avoiding it, I sped up because I was just going to go right over the top of it. Well, that was my plan anyway. My plan didn’t work out so well because as I launched across I didn’t have enough lift and I ended up nose diving into the other side of the bank. I was going fast enough that I didn’t end up in the water, but slamming into the bank wasn’t any better. Back then the machines didn’t have all these covers on them. The motor was actually exposed and the carburetor was actually right there in front of you. As I collided into the other side, I hit my knee and leg area against the snow machine engine. After I pulled myself together and surveyed the scene - the impact had knocked me off - I thought, man, I came through that pretty good. I didn’t end up with a snow machine in the water. <br /><br />I looked down and had a little cut in my pant leg. I had some heavily insulated snow machine pants on, but there was a little V cut in my pants and I thought, uh oh, that doesn’t look good. So I looked through that tear and noticed that there was a tear in my levi’s underneath the pants. I went uh oh, this could be ugly, because it really hurt. I dug down a little bit deeper and got to scanning and found that my skin was fine. At least so I thought. I was doing this as I was sitting on a snow machine. Anyway, it turns out that I stood up and tried to walk it off and it really wasn’t walking off. It was really hurting. As I was standing up my pant leg fell down 2-3 inches more than if you were sitting down. When I re-examined the holes, I saw that the carburetor had punctured my pants, Levis and my skin. So I had a big gash right above my knee in the muscle of my thigh. Needless to say, that ended our trip. We drove back as fast as we could to the pickup at the cabin and loaded up the machines and headed back down. Todd was driving and he was really worried because he thought I was going unconscious. I don’t remember that, but it took about 15 stitches to close up the wound. It was pretty good size and I still have the scar on my left leg to show that experience. After all our high school years, that was about the worst we had when it came to all our accidents, so I consider myself pretty lucky.</span>

        <span id="textspanf7">Mr. Nice Guy<br /></span><span id="textspanf8">Robert Bird, brother<br /></span><span id="textspanf9"><br />I remember one day after playing ball at the rec center in Rock Springs, Wyoming, we both walked past a huge mirror on a wall at the same time. As we looked at our images in the mirror, we noticed how similar we were in body proportions. We were pretty much the same height. Our necks, shoulders waist and legs all matched up to each other. We had never thought about how similar we were until we were staring at each other in that full length mirror. Now granted anyone who knows the two of us would never say we looked the same. I was thicker and broader and weighed 30 more pounds than Randy for most of our lives.<br /><br />As brothers we shared many similar experiences, but the most fun was playing basketball against each other. You have to understand that I was the most accomplished basketball player in our family and no one was going to take my place. I started two years at Madison High School and would be considered a decent player. When we were younger, Randy would challenge me and I would overwhelm him with size and experience. I could hit the outside jump shot or drive him to my left and hit the 6-8 foot hook shot. I was left handed and had perfected that shot years earlier. Early on I played Randy mostly for practice and to help him learn the game. I wanted more than anything for him to be good enough that he could make the school team and enjoy that experience. You have to understand that Randy was not a physical player. He was a finesse player. He scored mostly by timing. He would fake you one way and shoot the other. Over time he became more competitive and slowly developed a fade away jump shot along the baseline.</span><br />

        <p id="_Randy_never_made_the_high_school_team_Not_because_he_wasn’t_">
        Randy never made the high school team. Not because he wasn’t good enough. It was because he wasn’t mean enough. I had no problem collecting fouls and in many games would foul out. If the coach wanted to stop a player on the opposing team I would get the assignment. I had many talks with Randy explaining to him that he needed to play more physical and stand his position and not be pushed around by the other players. What came naturally to me did not come easily to Randy. By the time I graduated from high school I must have been in over a dozen fights. The only one I lost was the first one. I remember pleading with him to get tougher and to play and hold his position with more force. He would promise to get meaner but I would be fibbing if I told you he did. Over time I came to the conclusion that I was trying to teach Randy a behavior that was really not him. It was not in his nature to get what he wanted by force or by intimidation. He was happy being the nice guy. Later after we were both married, we played church ball together. Those were some of my most cherished memories. We won a couple of championships and had a blast being on the same team. We worked well together because we knew each other’s strengths and would feed each other the ball at the right time or in the right location on the court. Randy would feed me the ball for the long jump shot or when I was crossing to my left for the layup or left handed hook. I would feed Randy the ball on the baseline for his patented fade away jump shot.<br /><br />One thing did change though after high school. Randy continued to practice his jump shot along the baseline. I have to admit that he became so good at that shot that I could not block it even if I was nose to nose with him. Games to 21 that I would win became fewer and far between. It became a stalemate as to who would win or lose.  It would get so competitive that my happiness for that week would be determined by whether or not I beat Randy in a game to 21. I remember another game with a smile. We were on opposite sides with Randy and Dad on one team and I think John Wilcox and myself on the other. When it was all over -- I can’t remember who won -- my dad had caught an elbow on the corner of his left eye. It swelled up into a huge goose egg and over the next few days turned into the ugliest, darkest black and blue bruise I had ever seen. Every time I saw my dad for the next couple of weeks he looked like he had been in a war zone. I felt bad for him, but he took it all in stride because that is how life is. If you get beat up or knocked down or your son clocks you in the eye, you maintain a good attitude and get back up and get on with life.<br /><br />

        In this world there are many ways to success. Our dad used to tell us a saying that I have remembered my whole life. “It’s not the size of the man in the fight. It’s the size of the fight in the man.” In Randy’s case, he figured out his way of doing things was to be steady and consistent, to never give up and to just continue to do the right thing and all would work out for the best.<br /><br />
