                   We live in a troubled world. We have difficult times. We have spiritually-wrenching times in our lives when we need spiritual help. I know that we can't do things alone. We have to have help from our Heavenly Father with His Spirit to strengthen us and help bolster our faith. The one phrase that means the most to me is, “I can do hard.”

                    I first heard those words when Marian's sister Carmel mentioned it. I don't remember what the circumstances were, but my son Marlon told me that she was talking to her daughters. Her daughters were commenting about something very difficult for them to do, and they didn't think they could do it. Carmel looked at them and said, “We can do hard. You can do this. I know you can because we can do hard.” <br /><br />

                    After Marlon told me about that and I heard those words, they seemed to go deep into my heart. They mean a great deal to me. They've helped me do some hard things. I keep that phrase on my shelf in my office and I look at it every day. It helps to get me through the days, because I know with the help and strength I get from Heavenly Father that I can do hard, and I try.

            <span id="BigFirstLetterText"></span>I've been asked to share some of the most courageous things that I have done that have made changes in my life. I would have to say that getting married is just about the most courageous thing any one person can do. To meet someone and give your life to them takes a lot of courage! My marrying Kenneth and moving to a farm took a lot of courage. We had a wonderful marriage and a lot of blessings while we lived on that farm, but it was courageous because I never really wanted to live on a farm. But you find someone, you love them, and you're willing to change your past and go on into a whole new way of life. <br />

            <span id="ChapterParagraphTwo">
                Another time that took a lot of courage was to accept the mission call to go to Guatemala. It was a total surprise to us when we were called, and it took courage to make preparations and go to a country where we had to learn another language and participate in activities that were totally new to us.<br /><br />

                Later I accepted the call to go to the Mexico City Mission after Kenneth had passed away. That took a lot of courage, too. But when you have the Lord's help, when He asks you and calls you, you just go do it. You just do what He asks you to do, and the blessings come.

                    Living in Rigby has a few advantages that those who live in the “big cities” don't have. The post office folks knew that I was waiting for a call so on the day it was to arrive, and it didn't appear in my mail box, the dreaded wait was extended for a few more hours, the mission papers came in later in the day at the post office so when they arrived the post office folks called my home and Shawn went over to pick them up, called Marlon. Marian. And Taylor then presented the letters to me. And there it was, the temple in Mexico City. My very first thought when I saw the words was, “The temple, thank goodness it is for the temple.” <br /><br />

                    l have to admit that was some disappointment there, and there for some time. Why was the Lord sending me to the very place I had set my heart on that l did not want to go? Had I been counseling the Lord all that time when I knew that I shouldn’t be? Some of my most favorite scriptures are in the book of Jacob in the Book of Mormon, especially this verse: “Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand” (Jacob 4:10). This scripture took on a whole new meaning for me. I was troubled for quite some time about the call. I knew I would accept the call but my heart was not not involved, until one morning while reading the Book of Mormon in Spanish. I came upon another scripture that is a favorite, but I didn’t recognize it for a few moments because I was reading it in Spanish. This scripture confirmed to me that Mexico City Temple is exactly where the Lord wanted me. It was Jacob 1:17: “Wherefore, I, Jacob, gave unto them these words as I taught them in the temple, having first obtained mine errand from the Lord.” The impact at this time of a scripture that was very familiar to me in English but not recognized immediately in Spanish was pretty strong and it humbled me considerably and brought a flow of tears and a feeling in my heart that this was indeed right. So, here I go.

                One of them was early in our marriage, and we had a particular neighbor who was difficult for us to get along with. We had some difficult times working together—not socially, but mostly in the work element. I said some very, very unkind things to him. Within a couple of hours I knew that I had to go and knock on that door and ask for forgiveness. I was able to do that. The Lord helped me to do it. It was very, very difficult for me to do, but I was ashamed of what I had said. It didn't need to be said, it was my own opinion, and it was very unkind. I was ashamed of how I had behaved. So I went up and knocked on the door and asked them to forgive me. Everything was okay after that.

                    I had one other experience just this last year. We had a difficulty with a dishwasher that wasn't functioning properly. It wasn't cleaning the dishes. Time after time I got so upset because I had to wash the dishes after I took them out of the dishwasher. I called the supplier and found out that I was about three months past the warranty. Of course they would not do anything to help me with that dishwasher. I hadn't had it that long, either, but the warranty was gone. <br /><br />

                    One morning when I was in a vicious mood, I picked up the phone and called the dealer for Whirlpool in Idaho Falls. I told him how I felt, and I let him have it. I said, “I feel that I have not had a good experience with the appliance. I think that you should have at least helped me find out what the problem was.” I really let him have it over the telephone, and then I just hung up. The poor man! He just listened. It was not his fault, and it had nothing to do with him; he was just in the store. It took me about an hour and then I went back, picked up the phone, called the store again, and said, “I don't know who I spoke to about an hour ago, but I was very unkind, and I need to apologize. I'm sorry for what I said, and could you please tell the young man that I called back to apologize.” It was difficult for me to do.<br /><br />

                    I'm sure there are other instances in my life when I've had to ask for forgiveness for my actions and my words, but these two stand out.

I had seven grandchildren serving missions at that time, and I felt, “This is where I need to be. I’m alone. I need to be serving again.” To go out with seven other grandchildren in the mission field was a wonderful, wonderful blessing for me. And how could I do less? How could I possibly do less when I have the time and the means to do so?

                    This one particular time we were reporting to President Amado about our visit to the branches, and when we told how we were getting up to this particular branch, he got really upset and he told us we should never go up on that road, that we should go around the other way to get to that branch, because the particular road we had been traveling on had banditos everywhere. It was a very dangerous road. Even the people in Guatemala in that area didn’t go up on that road to get to that branch. <br /><br /> 

                    We said, “President, we’ve been going up there half a dozen times. We’re perfectly safe. We’re okay.” He said, “Don’t ever go up there again by that road. You take the other road and go around the other way.” We laughed. The President did not laugh; we kind of smiled a little bit, but we obeyed. The next time we went back, we took the other road, and we had to ford a stream to cross it, so we didn’t really enjoy it. If we had gone the other way we wouldn’t have had to cross that stream two times. The way we wanted to go we only had to cross it once.<br /><br /> 

                    One thing we learned while we were in Guatemala was that the Lord did watch over us. We had experiences where we could have been in danger, but because of choices that we made and the whisperings of the Spirit, we made the right choice, even if President Amado had to help us make that choice. <br /><br /> 

                    One other time that was kind of a humorous experience was when we were in Guatemala City. The guerillas were very active in that area. Guatemala City had a lot of distress. The presidential home had sandbags all around it, and there was military guarding the presidential home all of the time. As we traveled throughout the area, oftentimes when we would come closer into Guatemala City, we would be stopped by the police. They would pull us over to the side of the road, and we would have to get out of our car. They would inspect our car. They would look in the trunk and in the motor and everything to see if there was anything that we were doing wrong. That was something that happened quite often. <br /><br /> 

                    Later in the mission, they didn’t even stop us. If we stopped and rolled down the window, they’d ask us some questions. They could see that our Spanish was not very good. We told them we were missionaries, so they would just wave us on. One rather funny thing that happened one time was we were going out to a zone meeting with President Amado and one of his assistants. They were in the car ahead of us, and Elder Bird and I were following in our car. We came to one point in the road. The president’s car had been stopped by the military, and they were out of the car, he and the elder, and they were being inspected bodily, as well as their car. They practically took the car apart to see if there was anything in there that shouldn’t be. We pulled up and we could see what was happening. The policeman came over and we rolled down our window and we told him who we were. He said, “You just go on. No problemo. Just go ahead.” <br /><br /> 

                    When we got down to where we were having our zone meeting, I went to President Amado and I said, “Presidente, if you ever need any help in any difficulty, you just come to Elder Bird and I, and we will help you.”<br /><br /> 

                    We learned that we were watched over carefully. Our blessings were great down there. We had no fear, even though the military checked us time and time again. We had no fear at all. We felt totally safe. We knew we were being watched over. We had a wonderful experience in that mission. As I reflect back on those times, they’re some of my very choicest memories.

            <span id="BigFirstLetterText"></span>I must admit that there have been many times in this mission when I have wondered if I could really do this. Mexico has never been my favorite place or even a place I wanted to visit another time after my initial visit when Ken and Ray and Larene and I and some of Ken’s family (his parents and Dean and Elaine and some “border visits” from Mesa). But here I am and the frustrations, doubts, fears, and all the negative stuff that comes to disturb have really put me almost completely down at times.

                My family, my children and grandchildren, brothers and sister, have just helped me so much and buoyed my spirit in so many ways and strengthened me through letters, email, cards, pictures, and the spiritual help that I have from the scriptures, my patriarchal blessing, and from friends here in the mission, and especially being able to serve at the same time as six missionary grandchildren. <br /><br />

                Well, the Lord has just helped me in so many ways and from such wonderful and spiritual sources. “My cup runneth o’er” and I know that I really can do this. I know that when the days that are sort of “down” come along and I feel so homesick, that I can get the strength and support I need from counting my blessings and being grateful for all Heavenly Father has given me.

                    This one particular time we were reporting to President Amado about our visit to the branches, and when we told how we were getting up to this particular branch, he got really upset and he told us we should never go up on that road, that we should go around the other way to get to that branch, because the particular road we had been traveling on had banditos everywhere. It was a very dangerous road. Even the people in Guatemala in that area didn’t go up on that road to get to that branch. <br /><br /> 

                    We said, “President, we’ve been going up there half a dozen times. We’re perfectly safe. We’re okay.” He said, “Don’t ever go up there again by that road. You take the other road and go around the other way.” We laughed. The President did not laugh; we kind of smiled a little bit, but we obeyed. The next time we went back, we took the other road, and we had to ford a stream to cross it, so we didn’t really enjoy it.
